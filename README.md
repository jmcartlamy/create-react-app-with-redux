## Create React App with Redux

Starter Pack with ReactJS and Redux.

This project was bootstrapped with :

* [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app)
* [Redux](https://github.com/reactjs/redux)
* [SASS Support](https://github.com/rickharrison/create-react-app-sass)

### SASS Support

If you prefer node-sass, you can eject your app with `npm run eject` and install that dependency and sass-loader :
```
npm install --save-dev node-sass sass-loader
```
Don't forget to modify your `webpack.config.js` in the folder /config.

### Note
